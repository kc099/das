Additions in future:

Websockets based syreaming, authentication and enpoint creations. is encryption necessary? 
Add devices tabs. Device templates? OEE, Andon, Energy Monitoring. 


To test MQTT edit username, pwd and ACL rules. 

Webhooks in blynk IoT on;y fetches data from a url without publisin to it. 

Based on my analysis of the flow editor image and both codebases, here's a comprehensive implementation
  plan for flow execution:

  Flow Execution Implementation Plan

  Architecture Overview

  The system needs a Node-Based Flow Execution Engine that can:
  1. Process different node types (Input, Output, Function, Network, Storage, Device)
  2. Handle real-time data streaming from IoT devices
  3. Execute flows in background tasks
  4. Provide real-time execution feedback

  Core Components

  1. Node Processor Architecture

  Each node type needs specific processor classes:

  # Django Backend: flows/processors/
  base_processor.py       # Abstract base class
  input_processors.py     # Button, Slider, Text, Number inputs
  output_processors.py    # Digital, Analog, Display outputs  
  function_processors.py  # Moving Average, Min/Max, Custom code
  network_processors.py   # MQTT, HTTP, WebSocket handlers
  storage_processors.py   # Database connectors
  device_processors.py    # Device interaction handlers

  2. Flow Orchestration Engine

  # flows/engine/
  flow_executor.py       # Main flow execution coordinator
  node_scheduler.py      # Handles node execution order
  data_pipeline.py       # Manages data flow between nodes
  event_manager.py       # Handles triggers and events

  3. Real-time Data Processing

  # flows/realtime/
  flow_websocket.py      # WebSocket handler for live execution
  data_stream.py         # Real-time data streaming
  execution_monitor.py   # Live execution status updates

  Implementation Strategy

  Phase 1: Core Node Processors

  1. Input Processors - Handle UI inputs (buttons, sliders, text)
  2. Device Processors - Read/write device variables via WebSocket
  3. Function Processors - Data transformation (moving average, min/max)
  4. Output Processors - Display results, trigger actions

  Phase 2: Flow Engine

  1. Dependency Resolution - Analyze node connections for execution order
  2. Data Pipeline - Pass data between connected nodes
  3. Event-Driven Execution - Trigger flows based on device data changes
  4. Error Handling - Graceful failure recovery and debugging

  Phase 3: Background Processing

  1. Celery Integration - For long-running flows
  2. Flow Scheduling - Periodic execution triggers
  3. Resource Management - Prevent system overload

  Phase 4: Advanced Features

  1. Flow Templates - Pre-built common patterns
  2. Conditional Logic - If/then/else flow control
  3. Loop Handling - Iterative processing
  4. Performance Optimization - Efficient execution

  Technical Implementation Details

  Node Function Structure

  class NodeProcessor:
      def __init__(self, node_config, flow_context):
          self.config = node_config
          self.context = flow_context

      def execute(self, input_data):
          # Process node-specific logic
          return output_data

      def validate(self):
          # Validate node configuration
          pass

  Flow Execution Flow

  1. Parse Flow JSON - Extract nodes and connections
  2. Build Execution Graph - Determine execution order
  3. Initialize Processors - Create processor instances
  4. Execute Nodes - Process data through pipeline
  5. Handle Outputs - Send results to displays/devices/storage

  Real-time Integration

  - WebSocket Listeners - Monitor device data changes
  - Event Triggers - Start flows based on conditions
  - Live Updates - Stream execution progress to frontend
  - Error Propagation - Real-time error notifications

  Database Schema Extensions

  # Additional models needed:
  FlowTrigger         # Event-based flow triggers
  NodeConfiguration   # Node-specific settings
  FlowVariable       # Flow-level variables
  ExecutionLog       # Detailed execution history

  Frontend Integration

  - Execution Controls - Start/stop/pause flows
  - Live Monitoring - Real-time execution visualization
  - Debug Interface - Step-through debugging
  - Error Display - Visual error indicators

  This architecture leverages your existing Django infrastructure (WebSockets, device management, MQTT) while
   adding the flow execution layer. The modular design allows implementing node types incrementally, starting
   with the most critical ones shown in your flow editor.
